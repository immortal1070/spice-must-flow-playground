# Recipes React project
This project provides frontend pages for https://github.com/immortal1070/spice-must-flow-playground/tree/main/recipes-kotlin-spring-ddd backend.
Currently it holds a page for ingredients management.

The goal is to try out latest Next.js version.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the *recipes-kotlin-spring-ddd* (it will be available on http://localhost:3001).
Then run dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/ingredients](http://localhost:3000/ingredients) with your browser to see the result.
You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!
